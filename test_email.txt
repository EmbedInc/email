test_email [<email address>]

Test email address manipulation.  This program can be useful in
checking and debugging the MAIL.ADR environment file set.  See the
MAIL_ADR documentation file for an explanation of the MAIL.ADR
environment file set.

If an email address is given on the command line, that address will be
read in and translated thru the MAIL.ADR environment file set.  The
result will be printed and the program will exit.  This mode is
intended for a quick check of the translation of an email address.

If nothing is given on the command line, the program will enter an
interactive mode.  A current email address is maintained and acted on
by commands.  The address is initialized to empty, and written out in
different formats after each command that modifies it.  Commands are:

  DEL [<token type>]

       Delete the specified address token if <token type> is given.
       Otherwise delete the entire address.  Token type names are:

         DOM_FIRST  -  First domain name

         DOM_LAST  -  Last domain name

         SYS_FIRST  -  First system name

         SYS_LAST  -  Last system name

         USER  -  User name

  ADD <address string>

       Add the incremental address to the current address.

  NEW <address string>

       Replace the current address with the address indicated by
       <address string>.

  XL
